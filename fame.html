                <h3>The Plane</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Family:</strong>  The YB-49 is part of a family of aircraft, known as "flying wings," because they have no tail or separate fuselage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Handling:</strong> Unimpressed by the plane's handling, Captain Edwards wrote in his diary that the YB-49 was "the dardest airplne I've ever tried to do anyting with.  Quite uncontrollable at times."  </li>
                    <li><strong>Great-Grand-Child</strong>  The B-2 Stealth Bomber, still in service, is a descendent of (and made possible by) the YB-49 test flights.</li>
